# Search and sharing metadata

The production base is `https://emu-rabbit.github.io/rabbit-hole-notes/`, configured in `src/web/seo.mjs`. Keep the trailing project path when the repository or host changes.

## Public routes

- Chinese introduction: `/rabbit-hole-notes/`
- English introduction: `/rabbit-hole-notes/en/`
- Chinese and English examples: `/rabbit-hole-notes/reader/index.html` and `/rabbit-hole-notes/reader-en/index.html`
- Sitemap: `/rabbit-hole-notes/sitemap.xml`

Both introductions and all 58 notes in each language are rendered as HTML at build time. JavaScript enhances the interface; it is not needed to discover the English introduction or read the notes. Language links work without JavaScript. Existing `?lang=en` or `?lang=zh-TW` links remain supported by the locale controller, which redirects to the corresponding static page. Homepage section anchors, shared source block IDs, and headings with a one-to-one mapping are preserved. Unmatched note anchors fall back to the corresponding page, as in the existing reader. With JavaScript disabled, a legacy query URL shows the static language at its pathname; use the visible language link instead.

Each page has one self-canonical URL without query parameters or fragments, reciprocal `zh-TW` and `en` alternates, and a Chinese `x-default` fallback. Titles, descriptions, Open Graph and Twitter cards are present in the initial response. Note descriptions use the first paragraph already published in the selected public example. Open Graph and Twitter large-image cards use `rabbit-hole-social-1200x630.jpg`, a 1200 × 630 (about 1.91:1) JPEG. The original `rabbit-hole.jpg` remains the homepage image.

The sitemap includes exactly the two introductions and 116 public note pages. It excludes ZIP downloads, scripts, navigation helpers, skills, repository files, and anything outside the two explicitly configured public example folders. No private vault is read. No fabricated modification dates, ratings, search keywords, or authorship claims are emitted. Navigation helper documents are `noindex, follow`; the reader imports only their body so the directive never reaches an article page.

## URL compatibility

Reader filenames follow the note path unless `src/web/public-url-compat.mjs` specifies an explicit identity mapping. Direct GitHub and raw-file URLs follow the Markdown filenames. When a rename intentionally changes URLs, update internal links and remove obsolete generated pages; add aliases only when URL compatibility is required.

## GitHub Pages and robots.txt

Crawlers use **`https://emu-rabbit.github.io/robots.txt`**, at the origin root. A file at `/rabbit-hole-notes/robots.txt` would not govern this project, so this build deliberately does not generate one.

After deployment, the owner can submit `https://emu-rabbit.github.io/rabbit-hole-notes/sitemap.xml` through their verified search-console property. The separate root-site repository controls the origin's robots file and can also list this sitemap. Changes in this project do not submit to search engines or modify that other repository.

Indexing and search ranking are controlled by search engines. A sitemap or valid metadata does not guarantee either. Social platforms can also cache previews. Check the actual deployed response after merging rather than assuming a local build is live.

## Verification

Run `npm run check` on Node.js 22 or later. No install is needed. Tests cover:

- Static English text, image descriptions, every structure panel, and note content.
- Every public page's canonical, language alternates, description, robots and share metadata.
- The 118-entry sitemap, self/alternate links, and exclusion of non-page artifacts.
- The social JPEG’s actual 1200 × 630 dimensions, matching metadata, and unchanged hero asset reference.
- Internal links, anchors and assets under the GitHub Pages project path.
- Legacy language URLs, paired note fragments, and HTML-safe descriptions.
- Existing translation completeness, note references, and safe ZIP creation.

The Pages workflow publishes from `main`; it does not run the full website test suite. Run `npm run check` before submitting website changes. The separate Windows skills PR workflow is described in the [development guide](../README.en.md#develop-locally).
